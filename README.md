### Project Description
The website is an electronic device repair/service platform service for service/repair brands that own a few stores in the city. This platform will serve as an all-in-one solution for these brands. This website will 
provide an interface to the customers to get their devices serviced as well as to the employees working at 
the stores, the store managers and the administrator to manage service requests. 

# How to use
Navigate to the `server.js` directory of our project folder. Once inside, run the following commands -

# Installing Dependencies
```npm i```

# Running the Project
```npm start```

# Database Seed
We are using a cloud variant of Mongo, hence the data is already present to the cloud DB. The details of the DB have been provided in ``config.env`` file.


Once the service is up and running go to  `localhost:3000/home` to take a look at our website.
