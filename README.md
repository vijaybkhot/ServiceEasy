## **Project Description**  

**ServiceEasy** is an all-in-one platform catering to a service repair company with multiple stores. This web application is designed to streamline the repair process for customers, employees, store managers, and administrators.  

We have created a comprehensive solution that allows customers to easily:  
- Locate nearby stores.  
- Explore repair options.  
- Get instant repair quotations.  
- Place service requests online.  

### **Store Listing and Detail Pages**  

The platform includes:  
- **Store Listing Page**: Customers can view all the stores on an interactive map powered by the **Leaflet** library, with store locations marked for easy discovery.  
- **Store Detail Page**: Clicking on a store marker displays additional details about the store, including available services, customer feedback, and the option to request a repair at that specific location.

The platform goes beyond customer support, empowering the repair company to efficiently manage its stores, store managers, and employees. The platform features dedicated dashboards for store managers and employees, enabling them to handle service requests from start to finish. The entire repair process is digitized and transparent, covering every step, including:  
1. **Order Placement** by the customer.  
2. **Job Assignment** by the store manager to an employee.  
3. **Job Completion** by the employee, followed by submission for approval.  
4. **Repair Approval** by the manager.  
5. **Handover of the Device** to the customer.  

The customer is kept informed at every stage via automated email notifications, and once the service is complete, they can provide feedback. This feedback is displayed on the store‚Äôs page, encouraging continuous improvement.  

The platform also includes an **Admin Dashboard**, offering a bird‚Äôs-eye view of all service requests across every store. Using this powerful tool, the admin can manage stores, store managers, and employees while generating detailed sales reports for performance analysis.  

To provide a seamless experience, the platform includes **Stripe payment integration** for secure online payments, ensuring customers can pay for services with ease.  

With a focus on end-to-end service management, real-time updates, and powerful admin controls, this platform serves as a scalable, future-ready solution for electronic device repair companies looking to offer an elevated customer experience.

## **How to Use**  

Navigate to the `server.js` directory of our project folder. Once inside, run the following commands:  

### **Installing Dependencies**  
```bash  
```npm i```

## **Running the Project
```npm start```

## **Database Seed
We are using MongoDB Atlas, a cloud-based database service, with the initial data already seeded in the database. The database connection details are specified in the config.env file. Currently, the database includes three device types: iPhone, MacBook, and iPad. Each device type contains multiple models, and each model offers various repair types, with each repair type having an associated cost and time estimate. The database currently contains 5 stores, all located in the New York area, with the flexibility to add more stores as needed.

Once the service is up and running go to  `localhost:3000/home` to take a look at our website.
